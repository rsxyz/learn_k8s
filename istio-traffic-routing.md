Traffic Routing Use Cases with Istio Ingress
Introduction
Istio is a powerful service mesh that provides a lot of capabilities, including traffic management, security, and observability. One of the key features of Istio is its ability to control the flow of traffic between services using Istio ingress. This document provides an overview of various traffic routing use cases using Istio ingress, along with practical examples.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

A Kubernetes cluster with Istio installed.
Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and Istio.
kubectl command-line tool installed and configured to interact with your cluster.
Use Cases
1. Simple Traffic Routing
Description: Route traffic to a single service based on a host and path.

Example:

```sh

apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: simple-gateway
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "example.com"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: simple-routing
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "example.com"
  gateways:
  - istio-system/simple-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        exact: /hello
    route:
    - destination:
        host: hello-service
        port:
          number: 8080
```
2. Canary Releases
Description: Gradually roll out a new version of a service to a small percentage of users.

Example:

```sh
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: canary-release
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "example.com"
  gateways:
  - istio-system/simple-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /hello
    route:
    - destination:
        host: hello-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 10
    - destination:
        host: hello-service
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: hello-destination
  namespace: default
spec:
  host: hello-service
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```
3. Traffic Mirroring
Description: Mirror a percentage of traffic to a new service version without affecting the main user traffic.

Example:

```sh
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: traffic-mirroring
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "example.com"
  gateways:
  - istio-system/simple-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /hello
    route:
    - destination:
        host: hello-service
        subset: v1
    mirror:
      host: hello-service
      subset: v2
    mirrorPercentage:
      value: 20.0
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: hello-destination
  namespace: default
spec:
  host: hello-service
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```
4. Fault Injection
Description: Introduce faults to test the resiliency of your services.

Example:

```sh
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: fault-injection
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "example.com"
  gateways:
  - istio-system/simple-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /hello
    fault:
      delay:
        percentage:
          value: 100.0
        fixedDelay: 5s
      abort:
        percentage:
          value: 10.0
        httpStatus: 500
    route:
    - destination:
        host: hello-service
        subset: v1
```
5. Traffic Shifting
Description: Gradually shift traffic from one service version to another.

Example:

```sh
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: traffic-shifting
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "example.com"
  gateways:
  - istio-system/simple-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /hello
    route:
    - destination:
        host: hello-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 30
    - destination:
        host: hello-service
        subset: v1
      weight: 70
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: hello-destination
  namespace: default
spec:
  host: hello-service
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
```
6. Header-based Routing
Description: Route traffic to different services based on HTTP headers.

Example:

```sh
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: header-routing
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:
  - "example.com"
  gateways:
  - istio-system/simple-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        user:
          exact: admin
    route:
    - destination:
        host: admin-service
        port:
          number: 8080
  - match:
    - headers:
        user:
          exact: guest
    route:
    - destination:
        host: guest-service
        port:
          number: 8080
```

Istio ingress offers a versatile and powerful mechanism for managing traffic in Kubernetes environments. By leveraging the different routing capabilities such as simple routing, canary releases, traffic mirroring, fault injection, traffic shifting, and header-based routing, you can effectively control and monitor the flow of traffic within your services, enhancing both resiliency and user experience.
